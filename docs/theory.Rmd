# Introduction {#introduction}

Computation of unstable periodic orbits in two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian systems arises in a diverse array of problems in physical sciences and engineering [@Parker_1989; @wiggins_introduction_2003]. The unstable periodic orbits exist in the bottleneck of the equipotential line $V(x,y) = E$ and project as lines on the configuration space $(x,y)$ for the Hamiltonian system of the form kinetic plus potential energy [@wiggins_role_2016]. The three methods

- Differential correction [@koon_heteroclinic_2000;@Koon2011;@naik_geometry_2017;@ross_experimental_2018;@naik_finding_2019b]
- Turning point [@Pollak_1980;@Deleon_Berne_1981]
- Turning point based on configuration difference

implemented in this package has been used for transition dynamics in chemical reactions, celestial mechanics, and ship capsize. We have included Hamiltonian systems with two potential wells connected by a bottleneck where the unstable periodic orbits exist for energy above the energy of the saddle equilibrium point. 

Consider the following two degrees-of-freedom Hamiltonian model where $x, y$ are configuration space coordinates and $p_x,p_y$ are corresponding momenta, $V(x,y)$ is the potential energy, and $T(x,y)$ is the kinetic energy.

### DeLeon-Berne Hamiltonian {#dbham}

This Hamiltonian has been studied as a model of isomerization of a single molecule that undergoes conformational change [@Deleon_Berne_1981; @DeLeon_Marston_1989] and exhibits regular and chaotic dynamics relevant for chemical reactions.
