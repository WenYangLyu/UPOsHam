# RecurrencePlot
RecurrencePlot is a method for visualising Unstable Priodic Orbits(UPO) in Dynamical Systems theory.

The code is saved in RecurrencePlot.py 

Recurrence Plot is used to determine the intial condition of the UPOs which is saved in RecurrencePlot_Initialcondition_determined.ipynb 


Varitional Equation is calculated and the result is saved in VariationalEquations.ipynb
