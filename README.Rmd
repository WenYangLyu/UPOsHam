## Summary

This Python package is a collection of three methods for computing unstable periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems that model a diverse array of problems in physical sciences and engineering [@wiggins_introduction_2003]. The unstable periodic orbits exist in the bottleneck of the equipotential line $V(x,y) = E$ and project as lines on the configuration space $(x,y)$ [@wiggins_role_2016]. The three methods [@Pollak_1980,@Koon2011,@naik_finding_2019b] described below have been implemented for three Hamiltonian systems of the form kinetic plus potential energy and a brief description can be found in the [paper.pdf](https://github.com/WyLyu/UPOsHam/tree/master/paper/paper.pdf). The scripts are written as demonstration of how to modify and adapt the code for a problem of interest. 

## Installation

Clone/download the git repository using
```git
$ git clone git@github.com:WyLyu/UPOsHam.git
$ cd UPOsHam
$ pip install -r requirements.dat
```
and check the modules shown in [requirements.dat](https://github.com/WyLyu/UPOsHam/tree/master/requirements.dat) are installed using conda/pip. Specific problems can be imported as modules for use in further analysis.

## Usage

__Comparison of the three methods for the coupled quartic Hamiltonian__
Comparison of the results (data is located [here](https://github.com/WyLyu/UPOsHam/tree/master/data)) obtained using the three methods for the coupled quartic Hamiltonian can be done using

```python
>> run run_comparison_coupled.py
```
and the generated figure is located [here](tests/comparison_coupled.pdf)

To obtain the unstable periodic orbits for a specific model Hamiltonian using a specific method, one uses

```python
>> run run_diffcorr_POfam_coupled.py
```

Other tests can be performed by running the cells in the run_alltests.ipynb
