## Summary


This Python package is a collection of three methods for computing unstable periodic orbits in two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian systems that model a diverse array of problems in physical sciences and engineering [@Parker_1989; @wiggins_introduction_2003]. The unstable periodic orbits exist in the bottleneck of the equipotential line $V(x,y) = E$ and project as lines on the configuration space $(x,y)$ for the Hamiltonian system of the form kinetic plus potential energy [@wiggins_role_2016]. The three methods implemented here (and available under [src](src/) directory) has been used in [@Pollak_1980;@Deleon_Berne_1981;@koon_heteroclinic_2000;@Koon2011;@naik_geometry_2017;@ross_experimental_2018;@naik_finding_2019b] for transition dynamics in chemical reactions, celestial mechanics, and ship capsize. We have chosen three Hamiltonian systems that have two wells connected by a bottleneck where the unstable periodic orbits exist for energy above the energy of the saddle equilibrium point. A brief description of these systems can be found in the [paper](https://github.com/WyLyu/UPOsHam/tree/master/paper/paper.pdf). 


## Installation

Clone/download the git repository using

```git
$ git clone git@github.com:WyLyu/UPOsHam.git
$ cd UPOsHam
$ pip install -r requirements.txt (or pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
```

and check the modules shown in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/WyLyu/UPOsHam/tree/master/requirements.txt) are installed using conda/pip. 


## Usage

The example scripts that computes the unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) for a given Hamiltonian system is in the [examples](examples/) directory with names ```<method>_<system>.py```. For example, to compute the unstable periodic orbits (the default shows at 2 total energy levels) for the De Leon-Berne Hamiltonian [-@Deleon_Berne_1981] using the differential correction method can be run from the command line by calling

```
$ python examples/differential_correction_deleonberne.py
```

This will save data files in the current directory and save the following plot in the [plots](tests/plots/) directory.

The example scripts import the system specific functions and method specific functions to obtain the UPOs. These are written as illustration of how to apply these methods to new systems. 


### Comparing the methods for the coupled quartic Hamiltonian

We demonstrate how the UPOs computed using the different methods compare with each other for a specific system: coupled quartic Hamiltonian.

Comparison of the results (data is located [here](https://github.com/WyLyu/UPOsHam/tree/master/data)) obtained using the three methods for the coupled quartic Hamiltonian can be done using

```
$ ipython
>>> run ./tests/compare_methods_coupled.py
```
and the generated figure is located [here](tests/comparison_coupled.pdf)

To obtain the unstable periodic orbits for a specific model Hamiltonian using a specific method, one uses

```
$ ipython
>>> run ./examples/diffcorr_UPOs_coupled.py
```

Other tests can be performed by running the cells in the ./tests/tests.ipynb
