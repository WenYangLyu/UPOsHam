# RecurrencePlot
RecurrencePlot is a method for visualising Unstable Priodic Orbits(UPOs) in Dynamical Systems theory. We present the Recurrence Plots of the x component of trajectories for 1-, 2-, 5- cycles embedded within the Lorenz attractor.

The code is saved in RecurrencePlot.py 

Recurrence Plots can be used to determine the intial condition of the UPOs, we present a 'trial' code for determining the initial condition for a Lorenz attractor in RecurrencePlot_Initialcondition_determined.ipynb 


The varitional Equation is a matrix-valued time-varying linear differential equation. It's the linearization of the vector field along the trajectory, which is varied for different trajectories. The variational equation for Lorenz, Rossler, and a 2-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system are calculated and the results are saved in VariationalEquations.ipynb
