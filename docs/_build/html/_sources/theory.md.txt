# Introduction

This Python package is a collection of three methods for computing unstable periodic orbits in two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian systems that model a diverse array of problems in physical sciences and engineering [@Parker_1989; @wiggins_introduction_2003]. The unstable periodic orbits exist in the bottleneck of the equipotential line $V(x,y) = E$ and project as lines on the configuration space $(x,y)$ for the Hamiltonian system of the form kinetic plus potential energy [@wiggins_role_2016]. The three methods implemented here (and available under [src](src/) directory) has been used in [@Pollak_1980;@Deleon_Berne_1981;@koon_heteroclinic_2000;@Koon2011;@naik_geometry_2017;@ross_experimental_2018;@naik_finding_2019b] for transition dynamics in chemical reactions, celestial mechanics, and ship capsize. We have chosen three Hamiltonian systems that have two wells connected by a bottleneck where the unstable periodic orbits exist for energy above the energy of the saddle equilibrium point.
